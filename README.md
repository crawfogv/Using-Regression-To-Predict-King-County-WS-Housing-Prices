# Using-Regression-To-Predict-King-County-WS-Housing-Prices
Technology Used: Seaborn, NumPy, MatPlotLib, Pandas, Folium, geoJSON, StatsModel, Anaconda, Jupyter, and Power BI. Used python to edit the data types, removed outliers, drop a few columns, and created separate dataframes for particular sections. Then, regression was used to predict the monetary relationships between the most correlated variables. Assuming that our model is perfect we can predict if a home is undervalued or overvalued. A Power BI dashboard was built to focus on the zipcodes, and the home types that have good ROI value, therefore allowing an investor to jump on an predicted undervalued home and flip it for an acceptable ROI.
